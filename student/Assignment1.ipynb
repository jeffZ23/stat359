The “man + science − woman” list tends to align more with technical/STEM-adjacent concepts, while the “woman + science − man” list shifts toward different categories (often education/humanities/care-oriented terms depending on the corpus). This is a biased pattern because it reflects a stereotyped linkage between gender and academic/occupational domains rather than a neutral representation. A plausible source is imbalanced training data (who is written about doing what) combined with a distributional objective that makes words with similar contexts close, thereby inheriting societal stereotypes."

Large text corpora such as news articles, books, and Wikipedia reflect historical and societal inequalities, so certain groups are mentioned more often in particular roles or contexts (for example, men more often in leadership or technical roles and women more often in caregiving roles). Word embedding models are trained to place words close together when they appear in similar contexts, so they directly encode these uneven co-occurrence patterns. The bias is therefore not added intentionally by the algorithm but emerges naturally from biased language use combined with a distributional learning objective."
